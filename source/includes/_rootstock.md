# <a style="display:inline-block; min-width:20px">&#9096;</a> Rootstock

Rootstock is the first production sidechain of the Bitcoin network. It aims to extends Bitcoin capabilities without compromising its decentralization and censorship resistance properties. On the Rootstock networks, participants are able to interact with smart contracts using a token called Smart Bitcoin. The peg between Bitcoin and Smart Bitcoins is maintained by a federation of distinguished players and backed by merged mining.

The RSK Mainnet and public Testnet are now live and they both have full integration with Provable services.

Smart contracts on Rootstock are executed by an upgraded, but backward compatible version, of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Those are written using the programming language Solidity and are fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts.

The Provable Rootstock integration is in fact completely compatible with the Ethereum one, since Ethereum smart contract can be compiled and executed on Rootstock natively.
For more technical details on how to use the Provable service from within Solidity smart contracts, please refer to the [Ethereum](#ethereum-quick-start) section of this documentation.
