# Integrations

## Public Chains
Provable is integrated natively with the most widely used public blockchain protocols like the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Rootstock, EOS mainnets and testnets.

## Alternative Public Chains
Provable is constantly studying new public blockchain protocols and considering further blockchain integrations. Since the Provable Engine is completely blockchain agnostic and can interact via HTTP API, developers are encouraged to work on open-source independent Provable integration on the model of the Ethereum-Bridge.

## Private Ethereum-based Chains
Private, Ethereum-based chains can currently integrate with Provable by using the Ethereum-Bridge. Forks of Ethereum such as Monax included. More information on how to use the Ethereum-Bridge will become available in the [development tools](#development-tools) section or refer to this [StackExchange answer](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/11389/5819) describing how to use it alongside testrpc.

## Alternative Private Chains
Provable can already be used in most private chains, in case you were interested in using it in a context where it is not integrated yet please [reach out to us](mailto:info@oraclize.it).

## Non-blockchain Applications
The <a href="https://github.com/oraclize/oraclize-lib">oraclize-lib</a> enables the use of the Provable engine capabilities also in a non-blockchain context, by providing an abstraction layer which resolves to Provable HTTP API. The oraclize-lib is currently in an experimental stage.
